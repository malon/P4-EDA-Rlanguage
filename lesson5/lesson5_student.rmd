### Third Qualitative Variable
Notes:

```{r Third Qualitative Variable}
ggplot(aes(x = gender, y = age),
       data = subset(pf, !is.na(gender))) + geom_boxplot() +
  #before:  geom_line(stat = 'summary', fun.y = quantile, fun.args = list(probs = .1), linetype = 2, color= 'blue') 
  #shape = 4 is an x
  stat_summary(fun.y = mean, geom = 'point', shape = 4)

#ADDING THE THIRD VARIABLE
ggplot(aes(x = age, y = friend_count), 
       #omitting those with non available gender
       data = subset(pf, !is.na(gender))) +
  geom_line(aes(color = gender), stat = 'summary', fun.y = median)
  
```

```{r Assigment with dplyr}
# Write code to create a new data frame,
# called 'pf.fc_by_age_gender', that contains
# information on each age AND gender group.

# The data frame should contain the following variables:

#    mean_friend_count,
#    median_friend_count,
#    n (the number of users in each age and gender grouping)

# Here is an example of the structure of your data frame. Your
# data values will be different. Note that if you are grouping by
# more than one variable, you will probably need to call the
# ungroup() function. 

#   age gender mean_friend_count median_friend_count    n
# 1  13 female          247.2953                 150  207
# 2  13   male          184.2342                  61  265
# 3  14 female          329.1938                 245  834
# 4  14   male          157.1204                  88 1201

pf <- read.delim('pseudo_facebook.tsv')
suppressMessages(library(dplyr))

pf.fc_by_age_gender <- pf %>%
  filter(!is.na(gender)) %>% #instead of subsetting we use filters
  group_by(age, gender) %>%
  summarise(mean_friend_count = mean(friend_count),
            median_friend_count = median(as.numeric(friend_count)),
            n = n()) %>%
  ungroup() %>% #ungrouping doesn't change the data - it changes the container type, from a grouped_df to a dataframe. 
  arrange (age, gender)

class(pf.fc_by_age_gender)

head(pf.fc_by_age_gender)

# group_by creates a grouped_df. If you group by one variable and apply summarise, the result will be a df. But if you group by two variables the summarise operation wonÂ´t change it back to dataframe, you have to ungroup it if you want.
```

Remember:
Important Notice! Please note that in newer versions of dplyr (0.3.x+), the syntax %.% has been deprecated and replaced with %>%. Videos in the course use %.%, which will produce warning messages. If you answer using the chain operator, you should use %>% instead.

Another warning: Version 0.4.0 of dplyr has a bug when using the median function on the summarize layer, depending on the nature of the data being summarized. You may need to cast the data as a numeric (float) type to get the expected results, e.g. median(as.numeric(var)).

You can include multiple variables to split the data frame when using group_by() function in the dplyr package.

new_groupings <- group_by(data, variable1, variable2)

OR 
using chained commands...

new_data_frame <- data_frame %>%
  group_by(variable1, variable2) %>%

### Plotting Conditional Summaries
Notes:

```{r Plotting Conditional Summaries}
ggplot(aes(x = age, y = median_friend_count),
       data = subset(pf.fc_by_age_gender, !is.na(gender))) +
  geom_line(aes(color = gender))
```

### Thinking in Ratios
Notes: The question would be how many times more friends does the average female user have than the male user.

### Reshaping Data
Notes:

```{r}
#reshape is mor complex than tidyr
install.packages('reshape2')
library(reshape2)

#dcast because we want a datafram, acast would be for arrays and so on

pf.fc_by_age_gender.wide <- dcast(pf.fc_by_age_gender,
                                  age ~ gender,
                                  value.var = 'median_friend_count')
head(pf.fc_by_age_gender.wide)
```

```{r}
install.packages('dplyr')
library(dplyr)
install.packages('tidyr')
library(tidyr)


pf.fc_by_age_gender.wide <-
  subset(pf.fc_by_age_gender[c('age', 'gender', 'median_friend_count')],
         !is.na(gender)) %>%
  spread(gender, median_friend_count) %>%
  mutate(ratio = male / female)

head(pf.fc_by_age_gender.wide)
```

            stat = "summary",
